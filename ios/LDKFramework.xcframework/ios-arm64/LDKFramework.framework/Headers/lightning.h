    * have been successfully applied, ChannelManager::channel_monitor_updated can be used to

    * you return a TemporaryFailure you must ensure that it is written to disk safely before
    * writing out the latest ChannelManager state.
    *
    * Even when a channel has been \"frozen\" updates to the ChannelMonitor can continue to occur
    * (eg if an inbound HTLC which we forwarded was claimed upstream resulting in us attempting
    * to claim it on this channel) and those updates must be applied wherever they can be. At

    * be returned to get things on-chain ASAP using only the in-memory copy. Obviously updates to

    * channel_monitor_updated to ensure you have the latest monitor and re-enable normal channel
    * operation.
    *
    * Note that the update being processed here will not be replayed for you when you call
    * ChannelManager::channel_monitor_updated, so you must store the update itself along
    * with the persisted ChannelMonitor on your own local disk prior to returning a
    * TemporaryFailure. You may, of course, employ a journaling approach, storing only the
    * ChannelMonitorUpdate on disk without updating the monitor itself, replaying the journal at
    * reload-time.
    *
    * For deployments where a copy of ChannelMonitors and other local state are backed up in a

/**
 * Manager which keeps track of a number of channels and sends messages to the appropriate

 *
 * Implements ChannelMessageHandler, handling the multi-channel parts and passing things through
 * to individual Channels.
 *
 * Implements Writeable to write out all channel state to disk. Implies peer_disconnected() for
 * all peers during write/read (though does not modify this instance, only the instance being
 * serialized). This will result in any channels which have not yet exchanged funding_created (ie
 * called funding_transaction_generated for outbound channels).
 *
 * Note that you can be a bit lazier about writing out ChannelManager than you can be with
 * ChannelMonitors. With ChannelMonitors you MUST write each monitor update out to disk before
 * returning from chain::Watch::watch_/update_channel, with ChannelManagers, writing updates
 * happens out-of-band (and will prevent any other ChannelManager operations from occurring during
 * the serialization process). If the deserialized version is out-of-date compared to the
 * ChannelMonitors passed by reference to read(), those channels will be force-closed based on the
 * ChannelMonitor state and no funds will be lost (mod on-chain transaction fees).
 *
 * Note that the deserializer is only implemented for (BlockHash, ChannelManager), which
 * tells you the last block hash which was block_connect()ed. You MUST rescan any blocks along
 * the \"reorg path\" (ie call block_disconnected() until you get to a common block and then call
 * block_connected() to step towards your best block) upon deserialization before using the
 * object!
 *
 * Note that ChannelManager is responsible for tracking liveness of its channels and generating
 * ChannelUpdate messages informing peers that the channel is temporarily disabled. To avoid
 * spam due to quick disconnection/reconnection, updates are not sent until the channel has been
 * offline for a full minute. In order to track this, you must call
 * timer_tick_occurred roughly once per minute, though it doesn't have to be perfect.
 *
 * Rather than using a plain ChannelManager, it is preferable to use either a SimpleArcChannelManager
 * a SimpleRefChannelManager, for conciseness. See their documentation for more details, but
 * essentially you should default to using a SimpleRefChannelManager, and use a
 * SimpleArcChannelManager when you require a ChannelManager with a static lifetime, such as when
 * you're using lightning-net-tokio.

/**
 * Arguments for the creation of a ChannelManager that are not deserialized.
 *
 * At a high-level, the process for deserializing a ChannelManager and resuming normal operation
 * is:
 * 1) Deserialize all stored ChannelMonitors.
 * 2) Deserialize the ChannelManager by filling in this struct and calling:
 *    <(BlockHash, ChannelManager)>::read(reader, args)
 *    This may result in closing some Channels if the ChannelMonitor is newer than the stored
 *    ChannelManager state to ensure no loss of funds. Thus, transactions may be broadcasted.
 * 3) If you are not fetching full blocks, register all relevant ChannelMonitor outpoints the same
 *    way you would handle a `chain::Filter` call using ChannelMonitor::get_outputs_to_watch() and
 *    ChannelMonitor::get_funding_txo().
 * 4) Reconnect blocks on your ChannelMonitors.
 * 5) Disconnect/connect blocks on the ChannelManager.
 * 6) Move the ChannelMonitors into your local chain::Watch.
 *
 * Note that the ordering of #4-6 is not of importance, however all three must occur before you
 * call any other methods on the newly-deserialized ChannelManager.
 *
 * Note that because some channels may be closed during deserialization, it is critical that you
 * always deserialize only the latest version of a ChannelManager and ChannelMonitors available to
 * you. If you deserialize an old ChannelManager (during which force-closure transactions may be
 * broadcast), and then later deserialize a newer version of the same ChannelManager (which will
 * not force-close the same channels but consider them live), you may end up revoking a state for
 * which you've already broadcasted the transaction.
